# Shadowhunters

*Shadowhunters* is my favorite TV series. It is a fantasy show based on *The Mortal Instruments* book series by Cassandra Clare. Here are some reasons why I love it:

## **Plot Overview**

> "All the legends are true."  
> â€” Jace Herondale

**Season 1**:
Clary Fray discovers on her 18th birthday that she is a Shadowhunter, a human-angel hybrid destined to hunt demons. Her mother, Jocelyn, is kidnapped, leading Clary to join forces with a group of Shadowhunters: Jace Wayland, Alec Lightwood, and Isabelle Lightwood. She learns that her father, Valentine Morgenstern, is a rogue Shadowhunter seeking to dominate the Shadow World. Clary and her friends face numerous challenges, including Simon, her best friend, being turned into a vampire. The season concludes with the discovery of the Mortal Cup, a powerful artifact that Valentine desires.

**Season 2**:
The battle against Valentine intensifies. He seeks to create a new Shadowhunter army using the Mortal Cup. Clary and her friends face threats from within and outside their group, including the manipulative Seelie Queen and the Greater Demon Azazel. Relationships are tested, particularly between Clary and Jace, who grapple with their feelings and the revelation that they might be siblings. The season ends with Valentine being defeated, Jace being killed and resurrected by the angel Raziel, who grants Clary a wish.

**Season 3**:
The group deals with the aftermath of Valentine's death and the new threat posed by his eldest son, Jonathan Morgenstern, who is bonded with the demon Lilith. Lilith aims to resurrect Jonathan, leading to a series of dangerous encounters. Clary and Jace's relationship faces further complications as Jace is possessed and manipulated by Lilith. Simon struggles with his new identity as a Daylighter. The season explores themes of identity, power, and sacrifice, culminating in an epic battle where Lilith is defeated, but Jonathan is resurrected.

**Season 3B**:
Jonathan, now fully resurrected and more powerful, becomes the main antagonist. Clary, initially thought to be dead, is revealed to be alive but under Jonathan's control. The Shadowhunters work to free Clary and stop Jonathan's plan to unleash a greater demon army. Alec and Magnus Bane face challenges in their relationship due to Magnus losing his magic. The final episodes bring intense battles and personal sacrifices, leading to Jonathan's ultimate defeat. The series concludes with Clary losing her runic powers and memories of the Shadow World due to forbidden magic use, but she finds peace in her normal life, hinting at a hopeful future.

The series is based on Cassandra Clare's YA novels, *The Mortal Instruments*, and is not connected to the 2013 movie adaptation of the same name.
