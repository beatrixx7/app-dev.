# Shadowhunters

*Shadowhunters* is my favorite TV series! It is a fantasy show based on *The Mortal Instruments* book series by Cassandra Clare. Here are some reasons why I love it:

## **Plot Overview**

> "All the legends are true."  
> — Jace Herondale

On her 18th birthday, Clary Fray realized that she is not who she thinks she is, but rather comes from a long line of Shadowhunters—human-angel hybrids who hunt down demons.Clary Fray then takes on a quest to find her missing mother(who was missing a few hours before), which leads her into the Downworld, an alternate New York inhabited by mystical faeries, wild warlocks, deceptive vampires, an army of werewolves, and demons. During her journey, she finds herself torn between her best friend, Simon, who is becoming more than just a friend, and the mysterious Shadowhunter, Jace. As Clary becomes part of the hidden world of the Shadowhunters, she realizes that rescuing her mother might endanger everything the Shadowhunters stand for. However, Clary, Simon, Issa, Jace, Magnus, Alec, and others will stop at nothing to get her back and save the Shadow World from danger.

The series is based on Cassandra Clare's YA novels, The Mortal Instruments, and is not connected to the 2013 movie adaptation of the same name.
